## CrossFit definition
CrossFit includes constantly changing functional movements performed at a relatively high intensity. All exercises are based on functional movements. 
It thus reflects the best aspects of gymnastics, weightlifting, running, rowing and other disciplines, also referred to as the key movements of life. 
The movements indicate the greatest possible load over the longest distance, so they are ideal for maximizing the amount of work done in the shortest possible time.
The intensity of the exercises is crucial to the results and is measurable as work divided by time or performance. 
The more work you do in less time, or the higher the performance, the more intense the effort. 
Using a variety of approaches to professional training, functional movements and intensity leads to a huge improvement in fitness. "

## CrossFit new Olympic sports ?
CrossFit as a stand-alone sport cannot be included in Olympic sports, within its versatility and by adding new disciplines every year. 
It does not have precisely standardized disciplines that would be constantly repeated, but this would make the sport lose its meaning. 
One of the biggest obstacles to the sport's inclusion in the Olympics is the lead under one man, Greg Glassman. Unfortunately, 
CrossFit does not fall under any federation or board of directors in which annual elections would have to take place in order to be able to elect new board members. 
Another obstacle is greater and more transparent testing for the use of banned excipients. CrossFit is used by a company called Drug free, 
which does not provide a public list of banned and permitted substances unless you are a member of that organization. 
Testing would have to be provided by the World Anti-Doping Agency, which provides testing for Olympic athletes, and its list of banned substances is available to the public.

## The new concept of organizing CrossFit competitions in the Czech Republic
The new concept represents a new form of organizing CrossFit competitions in the Czech Republic, which should be available for any licensed and unlicensed gym. 
It is about creating a certain chain of races, in the form of obtaining the titles of the best athlete for the gym in which the races would take place. 
The overall concept is based on the fact that races can be held in any gym or other place in its vicinity. 
All the requirements for holding the race are adapted to this concept, including the overall budget, the program of the race, the composition of the individual Wods, 
as well as the overall organization of the race. The aim is to create a larger number of individual races in different regions of the Czech Republic and thus consolidate 
the CrossFit community itself and expand awareness of this sport. In later years, this concept can be followed by new races in the form of individual gym fights, 
fights of the best athletes. from individual gyms or the declaration of the ultimate athlete for all gymi. The concept is to serve both for the promotion of sports, 
community support, as well as raising the level of Czech athletes and their preparation for international competitions. Through these races, 
it is also possible to create a certain symbol in the form of the best athletes who will have the best results and use them to promote this sport in the Czech Republic.
