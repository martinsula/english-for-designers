Every project is a challenge for me, which moves me and changes my view in graphic design for the better.

I grew up in a village near Prague. I love movement, I´m doing yachting for 14 years and now I am actively involved in crossfit. Sometimes I don't think about things that much and I just act. I'm rather quiet, but if I say something, it's worth it.
I am passionately collecting vinyl records, I like to try new things, traveling, playing games, make things and collecting experiences.
